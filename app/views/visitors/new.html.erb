<p>UTA-IT is reorganizing. We need a modern way to track incidents proactively at the highest level.</p>
<p> That means getting the big picture, fast. It means getting the right knowledge to the right people at the right time. 
It means using web technologies to get IT employees working on the real problems faster. It means using technology that gets out of the way so we can do our jobs.
</p>
<p> We can bring the future to UTA. And we can do it now. </p>
